# Project Core 3D Symbols
The Project Core 3D symbols consists of a set of 3D printable three-dimensional (3D) symbols that represent 36 words in the Universal Core vocabulary. The word category is indicated with the shape, texture, and color of the base. The individual word is indicated with a unique raised element, the printed word, and the word in Braille. This repository contains a copy of Version 4, last updated January 2020. For instructions on how to introduce and use these symbols, refer to the original site: http://www.project-core.com/3d-symbols/

## Getting Started

### 1. Determine which symbols are required
Refer to the usage guide and/or consult with the user to determine which of the symbols are required.

### 2. 3D Print the Symbols
All of the individual print files are in the [/Build_Files/3D_Print_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Print_Files/) folder.
Note that depending on the word class, there are 7 different intended colors of filament. The starter set (GO, LIKE, NOT) requires two filament colors: yellow and red. If printed in the intended colors, the full set of 36 requires 5 filament colors: yellow, blue, white, green, and red.

 Note: The original filenames have been changed to the following format: WORD_COLOR_VERSION.stl. This should make it easier to print the symbols in the intended color if so desired.
